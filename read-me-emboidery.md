It hives a brief outline of local artists and provides links to the gallery. The Gallery page provides a selection of artwork. Each artwork has a description of the picture which can be seen when hovered over. The website also has a page where local artists can submit a query, either to buy artwork or have their artwork showcased.

1. BROWSERS

I tested how the website looks in these different browsers while using Google Chrome as the main browser for testing and the DevTools for any appropriate change. I also texted all pages on a range of devices. All worked well and had no issues.

Google Chrome Version 107.0.5304.87 (Official Build) (arm64)

Mozilla Firefox 106.0.3 (64-bit)


1. LIGHTHOUSE

I used Lighthouse for testing: Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility, and SEO.

![alt text](../project-1-embroidery/readme%20photos/lighthouse.png)

Performance and accessibility previously had scores of 86 and 84. Lighthouse picked out large photo sizes as an issue as well as small menu text when screen size was reduced. I compressed all images and converted them to webp files. This allowed the website to perform much better. I also changed the color of the menu font. This allowed it to be viewed more clearly.

1. FORM TESTING

The form has method = post and the information is sent to: https://formspree.io/f/xvoynykn for collecting data.

1. I wrote in my own information and received this as a message.

![alt text](../project-1-embroidery/readme%20photos/conformation.png)

1. I received a notification from my formspree account showing what information had been requested.

**ISSUES DURING TESTING**

The issues during testing were through lighthouse. Performance and accessibility previously had scores of 86 and 84. Lighthouse picked out large photo sizes as an issue as well as small menu text when screen size was reduced. I compressed all images and converted them to webp files. This allowed the website to perform much better. I also changed the color of the menu font. This allowed it to be viewed more clearly.
